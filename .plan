Peopleware, adulting, expertise, get out of your way, Joel Spolsky I won't resolve your technical conflicts.
Working on shared problems gels teams, You will own your area of expertise. Software should work for humans

I'm here to be interrupted and to serve
Assumptions from Ben.README

Things I believe work: code reviews, TDD/unit-testing, Scrum/Kanban, plain text, MDD. Continuous pacing, making things
look easy, Human task switching considered harmful. Code is design
I manage for results, not appearances. Some results may be intangible.

Hi there, I'm Keith Sader, and I'm the responsible party here at $COMPANY. $COMPANY has entrusted me with
this department and the humans reading this to do some fun and profitable stuff. I can't wait to see what
we do!

These electrons will lay some foundations for our working relationship. Consider this the trial balloon for
the relationship we'll build here at $COMPANY. My primary responsibility to you is the following:
1. Find you interesting problems to solve and the context for why this problem matters.
2. Get you the resources needed to solve them and get out of your way while you're solving them.
3. Find other amazing people for you to learn and collaborate with.

A bit about me, I come from a software development background. You may have used some of my previous work:

I also wrote the foundational pieces for the USMC leave system. Semper Vacation!
I'm also passionate about surfing, fitness, and cooking. You can find me in the ocean or the running trails.

Let's talk about you.
Hello super smart adult who's going to help our users do great things. I already implicitly trust you
and your thoughts. Those ideas should grow and evolve while you're here with us. You know that doing the
difficult things are necessary from time to time and that your other teammates have $COMPANY's best interests
at heart. You know lots of things and aren't afraid to make the effort to learn those things you don't already
know.
