Hi there, I'm Keith Sader, and I'm the responsible party here at $COMPANY. $COMPANY has entrusted me with
this department and the humans reading this to do some fun and profitable stuff. I can't wait to see what
we do!

These electrons will lay some foundations for our working relationship. Consider this the trial balloon for
the relationship we'll build here at $COMPANY. My primary responsibility to you is the following:
1. Find you interesting problems to solve and the context for why this problem matters.
2. Get you the resources needed to solve them and get out of your way while you're solving them.
3. Find other amazing people for you to learn and collaborate with.

A bit about me, I come from a software development background. You may have used some of my previous work:

https://connect.garmin.com
https://www.equipmentwatch.com
I also wrote the foundational pieces for the USMC leave system. Semper Vacation!
I'm passionate about surfing, fitness, and cooking. You can find me in the ocean or the running trails.

I have some core processes I think my team should follow, subject to change/new evidence:
TDD/Unit-testing
Scrum XOR Kanban
Plain text rules all
Metric driven development will save you long sleepless nights
A continuous pace of development with limited interruptions is the best way to deliver software
Delivery pipelines save sanity
Software serves humans
Code is design

I manage for results, not appearances. Some results may be intangible - are people working well together, does person X write clearly.
I'll need to know when you're not available to work, but other than that, I don't think taking attendance is the best use of anyone's time.
I do care about our systems delighting users and being stable.

Let's talk about you.
Hello super smart adult who's going to help our users/customers do great things. I already implicitly trust you
and your thoughts. Those ideas should grow and evolve while you're here with us. You know that doing the
difficult things are necessary from time to time and that your other teammates have $COMPANY's best interests
at heart. You know lots of things and aren't afraid to make the effort to learn those things you don't already
know.

Daily stuff:
Interrupt me! I'm here to help, guide, and serve. Reach out to me via slack DM, email, or text. My calendar may be booked
with meetings, but my people will always get my time.

Feedback:
I believe in weekly 1:1s. I find the ritual of making time for communication useful for my sanity and to make sure nothing
in the workspace festers. For 1:1s, this is your time, use it. If you have nothing to discuss/need to focus for a day,
check in with me before cancelling. My feedback tends to be direct and polite. I'd appreciate the same.

I also feel that coaching is the best thing I can do during our time together. I'll always coach you up. No one has ever
been criticized to greatness.  If you're not a better developer after our time together, I have failed my mission.

Backgrounders:
I've come to management through multiple other managers and a bunch of reading. Things that still influence me are:
_Peopleware_ by DeMarco & Lister
_Software for your Head_ by Jim & Michele McCarthy
_The Effective Engineer_ by Edmond Lau
_The Pragmatic Programmer_ by Hunt & Thomas
Feel free to drop more knowlege and books on me at any time!
